## üéÆ Gameplay

- **Objective**: Match your character's color with the color of the platforms to pass through and reach the end platform.
- **Mechanics**:
  1. Use the `Cycle Color` button (mapped to a key or input) to switch between Red, Green, and Blue.
  2. Platforms become passable only when the player's color matches the platform's color.
  3. If the colors don‚Äôt match, the platform remains solid and blocks the player.
  4. Reach the final platform to complete the level.
     
- **Objective/Challenge**: Strategically plan your color switches while navigating through the level and avoid mismatches!
